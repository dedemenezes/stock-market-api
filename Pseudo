1. db schema

2. model / validations
  2.1. users / devise
  To be able to see all stock or update you need to be an API logged in user. Can create many bearers
  2.2. bearers / name unique, belongs to an user and can have a lot of stocks
  User can create a bearer associate to your self. Maybe an user can have only one bearer. Business logic...
  2.3. market_prices / Can't exist two market_price objects with same price and currency. can have many stocks
  Market prices will be created one time only. If a price already exist it can be or not assigned to one or more stocks.
  2.4. stocks / belongs to a bearer and to a market price 
  Our main model, need to have a price and a owner, Bearer.

3. Routes 
  3.1 Create a bearer
  3.1 List all stocks
  3.2 search from list stocks page
  3.3 Create a stock (Bearer and market_price)
  3.4 Update a stock
  4.5 Delete a stock, actually making some attribute false so it can be retrieved

Primeiro deveria fazer testes para os modelos.

Primeiro passo apos criar os modelos e definir as validacoes esta sendo definir a rota para o index de todas as stocks.
